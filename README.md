#Yii2-user-plus
Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset their forgotten passwords. Rather than re-implementing this on each application, you can use Yii2-advance-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval. 

If you finding something like this extension. I think you same as me before develop this extension. I have found some other extension to do this. But i notice some weakness of those that extension. So what's make extension different?

+ Easy for start implement
+ Powerful for customize
